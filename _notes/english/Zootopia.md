01:03 Fear,treachery,Bloodlust
01:11 these were the forces that ruled our world.
01:13 A world where prey were scared of predators.
biological urge to maim,and maul,and blood..
back then 
vicious predator and meek prey
and moved beyond our primitive,savage ways
Now,predator and prey live in harmony
And every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities.
I don't have to cower in a herd anymore
I can be an astronaut
I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore.
Today I can hunt for tax exemptions.
I'm gonna be an actuary!
I'm going to be a policy officer.
Bunny cop
It may seem  impossible to small minds
Where our ancestors first joined together in peace and declared that anyone can be anything!
you ever wonder how your mom and me got to be so darn happy.
Well,we gave up on our dreams and we settled. Yeah,we setteld hard.
that's the beauty of complacency 
heck
carrot farmer
Amen to that 
carrot farming is a noble profession.
Just putting the seeds in the ground,at one with the soil,just getting covered in dirt 
Where'd the heck she go!
I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.
cut it out  住手
nice costume ,loser
What crazy world are you living in where you think a bunny could be a cop?
Watch out 
Dumb bunny
Look at her nose twitch!

05:41 
Listen up cadets!

Scorching sandstorm

Frigid ice wall
Enormous criminal 
Filthy toilet! Fluff butt
As mayor of Zootopia,I am pround to announce that my Mammal Inclusion Initiative has produced its first police academy graduate.
Valedictorian of her class,ZPD's very first rabbit officer Judy Hopps.
Assistant Mayor Bellwether her badge.
Precinct one 
Bellwether,make room.
It's a real proud day for us little guys.

07:56
Really,it's kind of a proud-scared combo.
I've been working for this my whole life.
terrified
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
And he cheats like there's no tomorrow.
And foxes are the worst.
Actually,your father does have a point there.
Gideon Grey was a jerk who happened to be a fox.
this is fox deterrent,this is fox repellent.
For goodness' sake.she has no need for a Tax Taser.
Terrific!Everyone wins!
Oh cripes, here come the waterworks.
pull it together.
population

12:20
Luxury apartments with charm.
Complimentary delousing once a month.
Greasy walls.
Rickety bed.

13:06
He bared his teeth first!
They really did hire a bunny!
Me,Benjamin Clawhauser the guy everyone thinks is just a flabby,donut-loving cop,stereotyping you.
There you went,you little dickens.
I should get to roll call.
Bullpen's over there to the left.
That poor little bunny's gonna get eaten alive.

14:01
Atten-hut.
I've got three items on the docket.
All predators, from a giant polar bear to a teensy/tiny little otter. 
And City Hall is right up my tail to find them.
Assignments
Parking duty

17:12
hey,watch where you've going,fox.
I down't know what you'er doing skulking around during daylight hours but I don't want any trouble in here.So hit the road.
I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop for my little boy.
There aren't any fox ice cream joints in your part of town?
this goofy little stinker ,he loves all things elephant.wants to be one when he grows up.Is that  ?
Who the heck am I to crush this little dreams?
We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.So beat it.
You are holding up the line.  
You're gonna have to wait your turn like everyone else,meter maid.
Are your customers aware they're getting snot and mucus with their cookies and cream?
I believe scooping ice cream with an ungloved trunk is a Class 3 health code violation.
Which is kind of big deal.
I'd lose my head if it weren't attached to my neck.
please don't be mad at me.
My treat.
it burns me up to see folks with such backward attitudes toward foxes. 
I just wanna say you're a great dad and just a real articulate fella.
it's rare that I find someone so non-patronizing.

22:23
popsicles
lumber delivery
way to work that diaper,big guy
you kiss me tomorrow,I'll bite your face off.
ciao
I stood up for you,and you lied to me.Your liar.
it's called a hustle,sweetheart.
All right,slick Nick,you are under arrest.
how about selling food without a permit.
transporting undeclared commerce across borough lines.
false advertising. 
Receipt of declared commerce.
you told that mouse the popsicle sticks were redwood!
you can't touch me,carrots.I've been doing this since I was born.
you're gonna want to refrain from calling me Carrots.
I just naturally assumed you came from some little carrot-choked Podunk,no?
No, podunk is in Deerbrooke County,and I grew up in bunnyburrow.
Naive little hick with good grades and big ideas decides, "Hey,look at me!I'm gonna move to Zootopia where predators and prey live in harmony and sing "Kumbaya".Only to find ,whoopsie... we don't all get along.
our bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor living in a box under a bridge till finally she has no choice but to go back home with that cute,fuzzy-wuzzy little tail between her legs to become.
And that's not wet cement. 
Hang in there

25:05
how was you first day on the force?
Everything you ever hoped?
Holy cripes.
our prayers have been answered!
Glorious day!
Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.
turn down that depressing music.
She feels like a failure!
Tomorrow's another day.

26:53
sire,if you have a grievance,you may contest your citation in traffic court.
it was just robbed!
in the name of the law.
Cottontail.
Coming through!
I got dibs.I am in pursuit!

bon voyage,flat foot.

Did you see those leopard print jeggings?
come to papa
little rodentia

29:28
I popped the weasel
abandoning your post.
inciting a scurry.
reckless endangerment of rodents,
you did stop a master criminal from stealing two dozen moldy onions.
Hate to disagree with you,sir ,but those aren't onions.
those are a crocus varietal called midnicampum holicithias.They're a Class-C botanical ,
I grew up in a family where plant husbandry was kind of a thing.
your insipid dreams magically come true.
five minutes of your time.
she is supper-slippery.
He is a florist.
bless you
find my Emmitt.
Insubordination
you'er a former meter maid with delusions of grandeur who will not be taking this case.
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative is really starting to pay off.
Mayor Lionheart is just gonna be so jazzed.
Us little guys really need to stick together.
Thank you,ma'am.
you strike out,you resign.
splendid
leads none,witnesses none
I hope you didn't stake your career on cracking this case.  


33:23
it's officer toot-toot.
did someone steal a traffic cone?
hop along
And I alse know that,somewhere there's a toy store missing it's stuffed animal.
then we'll have to do this the hard way.
did you just boot my stroller?
Felony Tax Evasion
That's two decades.
Unfortunately,lying on a federal form is a punishable offense.Five year jail time.
well,it's my word against yours.
the only place you'll be selling popsicals is the prison cafeteria.
working with the fuzz

35:40
who may have frequented this establishment.
you should talk to his yoga instructor.
I'd appreciate that more than you can imagine,it would be such ..
you are naked!
we're a naturalist club!
does this make you uncomfortable?
there is no shame in calling it quits.
that's the spirit
weird
I have no memory of this beaver.
he is an otter,actually
he was wearing a green cable-knit sweater vest and a new pair of corduroy slacks.
And a paisley tie,sweet Windsor knot
Real tight.
needed a tune-up.the third cylinder wasn't firing.
you didn't happen to catch the license plate number,did you.
Told you Nangi has a mind like a steel trap.
well,I had a ball.
and seeing as how any moron can run a plate.
bid you adieu.
If onle there were a moron around who were up to the task.
you can't keep me on the hook forever.
I have a pal at the DMV.
if you need something done,he's on it.
We are really fignting the clock and every minute counts.
they're all sloths?
Flash,Flash,hundred-yard dash
Three-humped camel
pregnant
42:46
And I will bet you you don't have a warrant to get in.
Darn it.It's a bummer.
I have a fake badge.
I would never impede your pretend investigation.
does seeing me fail somehow make you feel better about your own sad,miserable life?
Now,since you're sans warrant 
First off,you throw like a bunny.Second you are a very sore loser.See you later,Officer Fluff.
I'm pretty sure I saw a shifty lowlife climbing the fence.
so you're helping plenty.
Polar bear fur.
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole.
those are claw marks.
Rat Pack music,fancy cup?
For old times' sake
that's a no
I may have sold him a very expensive wool rug that was made from the fur of a skunk's butt.
sweet cheese and crackers.

45:51
this is a simple misunderstanding
we broke bread together
Gram-mama made you a cannoli.
And how did you repay my generosity?
snooping around
A performer?
What's with the costume.
She is a mime.
And my evidence puts hime int your car.
So intimidate me all you want.
put'em down.
Ripped up the car,scared my driver half to death
but deept down,we are still animals.
a teensy/tiny otter did that?

49:49
down on all fours
He was a savage!
He just kept yelling about the Night Howlers
Officer Hopps to Dispatch.
Are you familiar with Gazelle,greatest singer of our lifetime,angel with horns.
Who's that beside her?
jaguar gone savage.
we'er sending backup.
Head for the sky trams.
Now,I can tell you're a little tense
maybe any aggressive predator looks savage to you rabbits.
you give her a clown vest and a tree-wheeled joke-mobile 
technically

55:33
never let them see that they get to you.
I was small and emotionally unbalanced like you once.
I wanted to do was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.
my mom scraped together enough money to buy me a brand-new uniform,beacuase,by God,I was gonna fit in.
Even if I was the only predator in the troop.
Pretty much born ready.
Now raise your right paw and deliver the oath.
promise to be brave,loyal,helpful and trustworthy.
If you thought we would ever trust a fox without a muzzle
How about we go out to Chuck in Traffic Central,
all over the canopy!
Pretty seacky,slick
I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into it now.

58:21
you do have a meeting with Herds and Grazing.
mutton chops.
you can't just touch a sheep's wool
It's like cotton candy.
I'm more of a glorified secretary.
But he did give me that nice mug.
shush 
Timberwolves.
Bet you a nickel one of them is gonna howl.
if I want to avoid surveillance because I was doing something illegal which I never have I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.
how dare you.
Acacia Alley
ficus underpass
south canyon

01:01:10
guess he's in no rush to get home to the missus.
Because I got a dozen and a half animals here who have gone off-the-rails crazy and you can't tell me why.
I'd call that awfully far from "doing everything" . 
we need to come forward.
I'll be ruined!
sweep the area.
I'm impressed.

01:06:12
you have the right to remail silent, Anything you say can will be used against you in a court of law.
are they all different species?
that is accurate.
Can you elaborate on that,please?
predators survived through their aggressive hunting instincts.
so we must be vigilant.
Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators?
I didn't get a chance to mention you,or say anything about how we.
I just stated the facts of the case.
Do you thing I might go nuts?
were you just threatened by that predator?

01:10:44 
More bad news in this city gripped by fear.
a caribou is in critical condition,the victim of a mauling by a savage polar bear.
Meanwhile,a peace rally organized by pop star Gazalle was marred by protest.
I'm from the savanna!
diverse
where we celebrate our differences.
we don't just blindly assign blame.
it is irresponsible to label all predators as savages.
I would seem you've arrived.
It's downstairs.
It's by the boiler.
With all due respect,sir,a good cop is supposed to serve and protect.
not tear it apart.
I don't deserve this badge.
thank you for the opportunity.

01:14:01
you ears are droopy.
And it made  life so much worse for so many innocent predators.
Speak of the devil.
Gid's turned into one of the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.
I'll be darned.
he bit the dickens out of your mother.
but it did hurt like the devil.
there's a siza ble divot in your arm.
not one bit.
I thought she was talking in tongues or somethin'

01:16:39
They'er toxic flowers. -- toxic poison
I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded.
But predators shuldn't have to suffer becuase of my mistakes. 
you can walk away knowing that you were right all along.
I'll let you erase it.
you bunnies are so emotional.
Step right up.
Make me an offer! 你说个价啊
The duke of bootleg.
Shouldn't you be melting down a popsicle or something?
if it ain't Flopsy the Copsy.
weasel
A ram named doug.
We got a drop spot underground.
Doug is the opposite of friendly.

01:19:58
Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornerd the market on Night Flowers.
Cheetah in Sahara Square,
I'll buzz you when it's done.
Hey,Doug,open up! We've got your latte.
It better have the extra foam this time.
we need to get this evidence to the ZPD!
you're a conductor now?
It would take a miracle to get this rust-bucket going.
We kinda(kind of) got a situation at the lab.
mission accomplished
would it be premature for me to do a little victory tool-tool?
Well.I can cross that off the bucket list.
I may have to rescind that victory toot-toot.
Maybe that's just hail.
Cut through the Natural History Museum!

01:24:48
Someone's darting predators with a serum.
I'm not gonna leave you behind.
underestimated,underappreciated
Aren't you sick of it.
prey outnumber predators 10 to 1,

01:28:58
Former mayor Dawn Bellwethe is behind bars today guilty of masterminding the savage attacks that have plagued Zootopia of late.
denies any knowledge of her plot claiming he was just trying to protect the city.
Did I falsely imprison those animals?
doctors say the "Night Howler" antidote is proving effective...in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.
turns out,real life's a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker.
Real life is messy.
we all have limitations.
hey,glass half-full,we all have a lot in common. (glass half-full meaning used to refer to an optimistic outlook on life)
I implore you 
you should have your own line of inspirational greeting cards,sir.
swat
undercover
we have reports of a street racer tearing up Savannah Central.
sly bunny

01:32:24
put your paws up.
