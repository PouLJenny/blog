I think I'm cursed.
And count their blessings.
He left with his guitar.
After banishing all music from her life.
she rolled up her sleeves.
she could have made candy or fireworks or sparkly underwear for wrestlers.
And later,she taught her son-in-law.
Then her grandkids got roped in.
Music had torn her family apart.
But shoes held them all together.
you see,that woman,was my great-great-grandmother,Mama Imelda.
I have dimple on this side.
you are a twig
I asked if you would like more tamales?

I am not like the rest of my family!
when he was crushed by a giant bell
I asked for a shoe shine not your life story.
I'd march right up to my family and say "Hey,I'm a musician.Deal with it"
He walked out onto that plaza.
The music competition for Dia de Muertos.
My family would freak!
Seize your moment?
Shame on you.

you have to have talent to be in a talent show.
our ancestors can come visit us.
so their spirits can cross over.
I don't want you sneaking off to who knows where.
Never mention that man.

10:52
you must have faith,sister.
Never underestimate the power of music.
No one was going to hand it to me.
Grab it tight.

13:50
The petals guide our ancestors home.
In the courtyard
you'll craft huaraches
