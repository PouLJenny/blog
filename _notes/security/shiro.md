### Authentication VS Authorization
|Authentication|Authorization|
|--|--|
|Authentication verifies who the user is.|Authorization determines what resources a user can access.|
|Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user.|Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.|
|Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process.|Authorization always takes place after authentication.|
|Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user.|Authorization isn’t visible to or changeable by the user.|
|Example: By verifying their identity, employees can gain access to a human resources (HR) application that includes their personal pay information, vacation time, and 401K data.|Example: Once their level of access is authorized, employees and HR managers can access different levels of data based on the permissions set by the organization.|
